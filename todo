TODO:


Do I want to grade regex for each student concurrent with grading functions?
Pro: can get their specific object names, allows for more precise regex target
     can give more specific feedback rather than there/not there.
Con: may be slower, requires rewrite.


Use explicit namespaces for all external functions.


Allow user to pass custom whitelist / blacklist.


Evaluate whitelist / blacklist before running functions to save time.
